# How-to for the CNM

Hi! Hope you feel good about your new role and responsibilities because they are 
very cool and highly important! 

First - if you will ever have any doubts - feel free to ask the instructor (CLO) or anyone in the team, you will be surprised how helpful and nice they are. 

Throughout the term, please help us update the notes below by modifying this page on GitHub (use the link at the bottom of this page).

## Notes

* Do NOT take notes directly on zyBooks! These do not automatically save and others may be editing zyBooks at the same time. 
* Message the Slack that you are editing, or "hacking into" zyBooks so that the other mentors are aware and there is no overriding. 
* During lecture, make sure Prof K is recording when she is supposed to. 
* After lecture, ask Prof K for the in-class code to put in notes, you do not need to type it yourself. 
* When students directly message you (general) questions, address it to everyone in the chat or directly message Prof K for her to address
  * Watch the chat! 
* Create a channel for action items and @ mentors and their tasks for the week.
  * Send each action item as a different message so that mentors can react when they have finished.
* Learn Markdown! 
  * Here is a lecture notes [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZhtSJunPkE3bSNcrCnDl2OzjpZ9P4LId3XPE2viKcU/edit?usp=sharing).
* Feel free to create your own simple example code to explain a concept for a question.
* Ask other mentors what are FAQs during their labs/office hours, and collect them for Prof K to answer in the next class.

Hope you will have an amazing mentoring semester! Have the best of luck!
